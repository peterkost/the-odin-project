<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This Russian salad recipe is what my mom and grandmother make every time there's a family gathering or a special occasion. Leave out the ham to make this a vegetarian dish. The potatoes, carrots, and eggs do not have to be completely chilled after boiling.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>6 potatoes, peeled</li>
    <li>1 carrot, or more to taste</li>
    <li>4 whole eggs</li>
    <li>6 large pickles, cut into cubes</li>
    <li>1 (15 ounce) can peas, drained</li>
    <li>½ cup cubed fully cooked ham, or to taste</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill, or to taste (optional)</li>
    <li>½ cup mayonnaise, or to taste</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add potatoes, bring to a boil, and cook for 5 to 10 minutes. Add carrots and whole eggs and continue boiling until potatoes are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and slightly cool mixture. </li>
    <li>Chop potatoes and carrot. Peel and chop eggs. </li>
    <li>Mix potatoes, carrot, eggs, pickles, peas, ham, and dill together in a large bowl; stir in mayonnaise until salad is evenly coated. </li>
</ol>
