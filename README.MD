### Admin dashboard

Completed 2024/02/28

Making this made me appreciate component based libraries. Even a single page like this gets out of hand when you have multiple similar components. The CSS could be cleaned up a bit, but it still would be too long.

### Testing Practice

Completed 2024/05/27

Coincidentally read Farley's Modern Software Engineering at the same time as doing this lesson. TDD is pretty based. I will now go and evangelize this new and exciting thing I just learned.

### Battleship

Completed 2024/05/31

Decided not to spend any time polishing this or implementing the extra features. I may comeback to it, but for now I have no intention of demoing this so I feel like it is not worth the effort.

### Homepage

Completed 2024/05/31

Unable to finish this one due to time constraints. The mobile layout is completed, but the header for medium and large is incomplete. I used the resolution of the sample images as the breakpoints, but I don't think that was the correct idea. The resolutions seem way to high. I may redo the breakpoints entirely when I revisit this at the end of the course.

### CV Application

Completed 2024/06/08

Feels good to finally get to the React section, so much easier to worth with then plain HTML/CSS/JS. Took only a few minutes to deploy to Vercel, how cool! Github pages was kind of ugly for a monorepo, but Vercel handles it perfectly (for my little use case at least).
